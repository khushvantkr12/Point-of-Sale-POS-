# Point-of-Sale-POS-🔖🔖🔖
I have developed a frontend website using **ReactJS, Zustand, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript**. The site includes the following key features:🚀





Select Services🎁: Users can browse and choose from a variety of available services like fitness classes, therapy sessions, or workshops.
<br/>



Add to Cart🔓: Services can be added to a cart, where users can view and edit their selections.
<br/>




Customer Management: During the checkout process, users have the option to input customer details such as name, email, and phone number.
<br/>



Payments💵: A simulated checkout and payment process allows users to experience a payment flow without real integrations.
<br/>



Receipt Generation: Upon successful checkout, the site generates and displays a transaction receipt with relevant details.
<br/>



Commands to Run the Project:
<br/>



**Install dependencies🎉:**
<br/>
**npm install**
<br/>




**Start the development server💻:**
<br/>
**npm run dev**
